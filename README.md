# SpinDecide Web Application

## Introduction
Welcome to the SpinDecide web application repository. This project serves as both a practical tool to help users make decisions and a personal development journey in front-end web technologies. The application features a spinning wheel interface where users can add their potential activities and let fate decide their next action.

## Motivation
The idea was born out of personal need for simplifying the decision-making process and to practice and showcase my abilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be intuitive, visually engaging, and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Semantic HTML5 for a solid structure.
- **CSS**: Modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for layout, along with CSS Variables for easy theming.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for handling user interactions and DOM manipulation.

## Development Goals
- To create a fully functional web application from scratch.
- To practice writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code.
- To improve my understanding of JavaScript and front-end design patterns.
- To experiment with advanced CSS techniques and animations.
